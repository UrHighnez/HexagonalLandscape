#Procedural Hexagonal 3D Landscape Generator
HexagonalLandscapeGenerator is a Unity project that generates a procedurally generated hexagonal terrain. It uses Perlin noise to create a heightmap for each hexagon, resulting in a dynamic and realistic-looking landscape.

The script is designed to work with hexagons of a specific size, and allows for customization of various parameters such as noise scale, minimum and maximum heights, and generation radius. It also includes a player tracking feature that generates terrain around the player's position.

This project includes a sample scene that demonstrates the generator in action. Additionally, it includes a TileManager script that keeps track of the generated hexagons for efficient memory management.

Feel free to use this generator in your own projects, or modify it to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request on GitHub.
